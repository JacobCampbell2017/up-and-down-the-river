# Up and Down the River - Game Rules

Up and Down the River is a simple and fun card game played over seven rounds (or 13 for the extended version). The objective is to score the **fewest points** by completing specific card requirements each round and avoiding leftover cards in your hand.

## Definitions

### Set

A **Set** consists of three cards of the same rank, such as:

- Three Kings (K♥, K♠, K♦)
- Three Fours (4♣, 4♠, 4♦)

### Run

A **Run** is a sequence of four consecutive cards of the same suit, such as:

- 3♥, 4♥, 5♥, 6♥
  The lowest card in a run can be a 3 and the highest card can be an Ace.

### Wild Cards

- **Twos (2s)** and **Jokers** are **Wild Cards**. They can replace any card to complete a set or a run and can be added to existing sets or runs.

### Discard Pile

The **Discard Pile** is where players discard their cards at the end of their turn. The first card of the game is flipped from the deck to start this pile.

### Buying a Card

When a player chooses to take the top card from the discard pile, they must also **draw one card** from the top of the deck.

## Game Setup

1. **Deck**: Use **two standard 52-card decks** (including Jokers), totaling **108 cards**.
2. **Shuffling**: Shuffle the decks together.
3. **Dealing**: Each player is dealt **11 cards**.
4. **Discard Pile**: The top card of the remaining deck is flipped to start the discard pile.
5. **Draw Pile**: The remaining cards form the **draw pile**.

## Rounds

Each round has a unique requirement that players must meet to **"go down"** (place cards on the table). Players aim to go down early in the round to avoid leftover cards in their hand.

### Round Requirements

| Round | Cards to Go Down                       |
| ----- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Two sets                               |
| 2     | One set, one run                       |
| 3     | Two runs                               |
| 4     | Three sets                             |
| 5     | Two sets, one run                      |
| 6     | One set, two runs                      |
| 7     | Three runs (no cards can be discarded) |

## Turn Sequence

Each turn consists of **three main actions**:

### 1. Draw a Card

The player must either:

- **Take the top card** from the **draw pile**, or
- **Take the top card** from the **discard pile**.

**Buying a Card**: If a player doesn't want the discard pile card, other players can "buy" it. To buy, the player takes the discard pile card **and** one card from the draw pile. The current player then draws from the draw pile.

### 2. Play Cards

If the player hasn’t gone down yet:

- They may lay down cards to meet the current round’s requirement (e.g., two sets in Round 1).

If the player has already gone down:

- They can **add cards** to any sets or runs already played (either their own or another player’s).

> **Note**: A player cannot go down and add to sets or runs in the same turn.

### 3. Discard a Card

To end their turn, the player **discards a card** onto the discard pile.

> **Exception (Round 7)**: The winner must play all their cards in one turn, leaving no card to discard.

## Scoring

At the end of each round, when a player has no cards left, the remaining players tally the points from their leftover cards.

### Card Points

| Card Type            | Points         |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| 3 – 9                | 5 points each  |
| 10 – King            | 10 points each |
| Ace                  | 15 points each |
| Wilds (Twos, Jokers) | 20 points each |

Each player's score from leftover cards is added to their total from previous rounds. Players start with **0 points**, and the player with the **lowest total score** at the end of the game wins.

## Example Turn

1. **Player A** draws a card from the draw pile.
2. **Player A** plays two sets (e.g., three Kings and three Fours) to meet the Round 1 requirement.
3. **Player A** discards a 7♣ to end their turn.

4. **Player B** sees the 7♣ in the discard pile and decides to "buy" it. Player B takes the 7♣ and draws an extra card from the draw pile, then continues their turn.

## Winning the Game

The game ends after seven rounds (or 13 rounds in the extended version). The player with the **lowest total score** at the end of the game wins.
