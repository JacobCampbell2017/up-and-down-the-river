# Up and Down the River - Game Rules

Up and Down the River is a simple and fun card game played over seven rounds (or 13 for the extended version). The objective is to score the **fewest points** by completing specific card requirements each round and avoiding leftover cards in your hand.

## Definitions

### Set

A **Set** consists of three cards of the same rank, such as:

- Three Kings (K♥, K♠, K♦)
- Three Fours (4♣, 4♠, 4♦)

### Run

A **Run** is a sequence of four consecutive cards of the same suit, such as:

- 3♥, 4♥, 5♥, 6♥
  The lowest card in a run can be a 3 and the highest card can be an Ace.

### Wild Cards

- **Twos (2s)** and **Jokers** are **Wild Cards**. They can replace any card to complete a set or a run and can be added to existing sets or runs.

- There is not a restriction to the amount of **Wild Cards** that can be played on a set or a run as long as their is a minimum of 1 non **Wild Card**.

- If there is a **Wild Card** in a run, a player can substitute the suited card that fits the value the **Wild Card** is placeholding. The Player then chooses to move the **Wild Card** to either side of the run, as long as the run does not preceed the 3 or exceed the Ace.

### Discard Pile

The **Discard Pile** is where players discard their cards at the end of their turn. The first card of the game is flipped from the deck to start this pile.

### Buying a Card

When a player chooses to take the top card from the discard pile during their turn, they only need to take that one card. However, if another player (out of turn) wants the top card in the discard pile, they must "buy" it. This process only applies after the current player has decided to draw from the deck instead of taking the top card from the discard pile.

#### Rules for Buying a Card:

- **During the Current Player's Turn**:
  - If the current player chooses the top card from the discard pile, they only take that one card and proceed with their turn as normal.
- **When Another Player Wants the Discard Card**:
  - If the current player decides to draw from the deck instead of taking the top card from the discard pile, another player may "buy" the discard card.
  - To "buy" the card, the out-of-turn player takes the discard card and must also draw one card from the top of the deck. This adds an extra card to their hand, making it a strategic risk.
- **Turn Continuation**:
  - Once the out-of-turn player "buys" the card, the current player continues their turn by drawing from the deck.

#### Example:

- **Player A** is the current player. They see the top card in the discard pile but decide not to take it. Instead, they draw a card from the deck.
- **Player B**, an out-of-turn player, sees the 7♣ in the discard pile and decides to "buy" it. Player B takes the 7♣ from the discard pile and then draws an additional card from the deck.
- After Player B "buys" the card, **Player A** continues their turn by drawing from the deck.

## Rounds

Each round has a unique requirement that players must meet to **"go down"** (place cards on the table). Players aim to go down early in the round to avoid leftover cards in their hand.

### Round Requirements

| Round | Cards to Go Down                       |
| ----- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Two sets                               |
| 2     | One set, one run                       |
| 3     | Two runs                               |
| 4     | Three sets                             |
| 5     | Two sets, one run                      |
| 6     | One set, two runs                      |
| 7     | Three runs (no cards can be discarded) |

## Turn Sequence

Each turn consists of **three main actions**:

### 1. Draw a Card

The player must either:

- **Take the top card** from the **draw pile**, or
- **Take the top card** from the **discard pile**.

**Buying a Card**: If a player doesn't want the discard pile card, other players can "buy" it. To buy, the player takes the discard pile card **and** one card from the draw pile. The current player then draws from the draw pile.

### 2. Play Cards

If the player hasn’t gone down yet:

- They may lay down cards to meet the current round’s requirement (e.g., two sets in Round 1).

If the player has already gone down:

- They can **add cards** to any sets or runs already played (either their own or another player’s).

> **Note**: A player cannot go down and add to sets or runs in the same turn.

> **Note**: A player cannot create additional sets or runs after they have played down the current round's requirement.

### 3. Discard a Card

To end their turn, the player **discards a card** onto the discard pile.

> **Exception (Round 7)**: The winner must play all their cards in one turn, leaving no card to discard.

## Round 7

Round 7 is the **final round** and has special rules.

### 1. The player who plays down must play **All** cards

Unlike previous rounds all cards in the hand must be apart of a run to be a valid play-down.

### 2. A run can be longer than four cards

## Scoring

At the end of each round, when a player has no cards left, the remaining players tally the points from their leftover cards.

### Card Points

| Card Type            | Points         |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| 3 – 9                | 5 points each  |
| 10 – King            | 10 points each |
| Ace                  | 15 points each |
| Wilds (Twos, Jokers) | 20 points each |

Each player's score from leftover cards is added to their total from previous rounds. Players start with **0 points**, and the player with the **lowest total score** at the end of the game wins.
